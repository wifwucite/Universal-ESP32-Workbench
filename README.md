# Universal ESP32 Workbench

**Plug in any ESP32. Serial and debug are ready instantly. No configuration needed.**

A Raspberry Pi that turns into a complete remote test instrument for ESP32 devices. Plug boards into its USB hub and control everything -- serial, debug, WiFi, BLE, GPIO, firmware updates -- over the network through a single HTTP API.

Zero-config by design: the portal pre-creates 3 fixed slots (SLOT1--SLOT3) at boot, each mapped to a physical USB hub port. Slots are always visible in the web UI even when empty. Plug in a device and it automatically maps to the correct slot by USB path, gets a serial port, chip identification, and OpenOCD for GDB debugging. Dual-USB boards (ESP32-S3 with sub-hub) are handled transparently -- both interfaces map to the same slot.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/Universal-ESP32-Workbench.git
cd Universal-ESP32-Workbench/pi
sudo bash install.sh
```

That's it. The installer sets up all dependencies (pyserial, hostapd, dnsmasq, bleak, esptool, OpenOCD), copies scripts to `/usr/local/bin/`, creates data directories, and starts the portal as a systemd service.

### Plug In and Go

1. Plug an ESP32 into any USB port on the Pi's hub.
2. The workbench auto-detects it within seconds.
3. Query the API to see what's connected:

```bash
curl http://workbench.local:8080/api/devices | jq
```

The response includes all 3 slots with serial URLs, chip info, debug status, and USB devices:

```json
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "label": "SLOT1",
      "state": "idle",
      "running": true,
      "url": "rfc2217://workbench.local:4001",
      "detected_chip": "esp32s3",
      "debugging": true,
      "debug_chip": "esp32s3",
      "debug_gdb_port": 3333,
      "devnodes": ["/dev/ttyACM0", "/dev/ttyACM1"],
      "usb_devices": [
        {"product": "USB JTAG/serial debug unit", "vid_pid": "303a:1001"},
        {"product": "USB Single Serial", "vid_pid": "1a86:55d3"}
      ]
    },
    { "label": "SLOT2", "state": "absent", "running": false, "detected_chip": null },
    { "label": "SLOT3", "state": "absent", "running": false, "detected_chip": null }
  ]
}
```

4. Flash firmware via RFC2217 (binaries stay on your machine):

```bash
esptool --port rfc2217://workbench.local:4001 --chip esp32c3 \
  write-flash 0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

5. Connect GDB to the auto-started OpenOCD:

```bash
riscv32-esp-elf-gdb build/project.elf \
  -ex "target extended-remote workbench.local:3335" \
  -ex "monitor reset halt"
```

Everything auto-restarts after a flash -- the workbench detects the USB re-enumeration and brings serial and debug back up automatically.

## Hardware Setup

### What You Need

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Raspberry Pi** (Zero W, 3, 4, or 5) | Runs the portal. Needs onboard WiFi + Bluetooth. |
| **USB Ethernet adapter** | Wired LAN on eth0 (wlan0 is reserved for WiFi testing) |
| **USB hub** | Connect multiple ESP32 boards |
| **Jumper wires** (optional) | Pi GPIO to DUT GPIO for automated boot mode / reset control |

GPIO wiring is optional. Without it, the workbench still provides serial and debug for every plugged-in device. GPIO is only needed if you want scripts to reset the DUT, force download mode, or trigger captive portal boot from the Pi.

### Network Topology

```
 LAN (192.168.0.x)
       |
       | eth0 (wired)
       v
  Raspberry Pi ---- wlan0 (WiFi test AP: 192.168.4.x)
  workbench.local      hci0  (Bluetooth LE)
       |             UDP :5555 (log receiver)
       | USB hub
       |
  +----+----+----+
  |    |    |    |
 :4001 :4002 :4003
 SLOT1 SLOT2 SLOT3
```

eth0 carries all management traffic (HTTP API, RFC2217 serial). wlan0 is dedicated to WiFi testing. They never overlap.

### Network Ports

| Port | Protocol | Direction | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 8080 | TCP/HTTP | Clients -> Pi | Web portal, REST API, firmware downloads |
| 4001+ | TCP/RFC2217 | Clients -> Pi | Serial connections (auto-assigned per device) |
| 3335+ | TCP/GDB | Clients -> Pi | GDB connections (auto-assigned per device) |
| 5555 | UDP | ESP32 -> Pi | Debug log receiver |
| 5888 | UDP | Clients <-> Pi | Discovery beacon |

## Services

### 1. Remote Serial (RFC2217)

Each physical USB hub port is mapped to a fixed slot (SLOT1--SLOT3) via USB path prefix in `workbench.json`. The same port always gets the same slot label and TCP port. Dual-USB boards (ESP32-S3 with built-in hub) expose multiple interfaces on the same slot. One RFC2217 client at a time per device.

Works with esptool, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, and any pyserial-based tool.

**What happens on plug/unplug:** udev detects the event, notifies the portal, and the RFC2217 proxy starts or stops automatically. No manual intervention needed.

**ESP32 reset behavior:**

| Chip | USB Interface | Device Node | Reset Method | Caveat |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| ESP32, ESP32-S2 | External UART bridge (CP2102, CH340) | `/dev/ttyUSB*` | DTR/RTS toggle | Reliable, no issues |
| ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3 | Native USB-Serial/JTAG | `/dev/ttyACM*` | DTR/RTS toggle | Linux asserts DTR+RTS on port open, which puts the chip into download mode during early boot. The Pi adds a 2-second delay before opening the port to avoid this. |

### 2. Remote GDB Debugging

OpenOCD starts **automatically** when a device is plugged in. The workbench auto-detects the chip type and exposes the GDB port in `/api/devices`. Serial and JTAG coexist on the same USB connection.

| Approach | Chips | Extra Hardware | Serial During Debug |
|----------|-------|:-:|:-:|
| USB JTAG (auto) | C3, C6, H2, S3 (native USB) | None | Yes |
| Dual-USB | S3 (two USB ports) | None | Yes + app USB |
| ESP-Prog | All variants | ESP-Prog + cable | Yes |

**Verified chips (USB JTAG):**

| Chip | JTAG TAP ID | OpenOCD Config |
|------|------------|----------------|
| ESP32-C3 | `0x00005c25` | `board/esp32c3-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-C6 | `0x0000dc25` | `board/esp32c6-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-H2 | `0x00010c25` | `board/esp32h2-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-S3 | `0x120034e5` | `board/esp32s3-builtin.cfg` |

For classic ESP32 boards without USB JTAG, the workbench automatically uses an ESP-Prog probe if one is configured in `workbench.json`.

### 3. WiFi Test Instrument

The Pi's **wlan0** radio acts as a programmable WiFi access point or station, isolated from the wired LAN on eth0.

- **AP mode** -- start a SoftAP with any SSID/password. DUTs connect to `192.168.4.x`, Pi is at `192.168.4.1`. DHCP and DNS included.
- **STA mode** -- join a DUT's captive portal AP as a station to test provisioning flows.
- **HTTP relay** -- proxy HTTP requests through the Pi's radio to devices on its WiFi network.
- **Scan** -- list nearby WiFi networks to verify a DUT's AP is broadcasting.

AP and STA are mutually exclusive -- starting one stops the other.

### 4. GPIO Control

Drive Pi GPIO pins from test scripts to simulate button presses on the DUT. The most common use: hold a pin LOW during reset to force the DUT into a specific boot mode (captive portal, factory reset, etc.).

**Allowed pins (BCM numbering):** 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27

**Important:** Always release pins when done by setting them to `"z"` (high-impedance input). A pin left driven LOW will prevent the DUT from booting normally.

**Standard wiring (optional -- only if you want GPIO control):**

| Pi GPIO (BCM) | Pin # | DUT Pin | Function |
|---------------|-------|---------|----------|
| 17 | 11 | EN/RST | Hardware reset (active LOW) |
| 18 | 12 | GPIO0 (ESP32) / GPIO9 (ESP32-C3) | Boot mode select (active LOW = download mode) |
| 27 | 13 | -- | Spare 1 |
| 22 | 15 | -- | Spare 2 |

### 5. UDP Log Receiver

Listens on **UDP port 5555** for debug log output from ESP32 devices. Essential when the USB port is occupied (e.g., ESP32-S3 running as USB HID keyboard) and you can't use a serial monitor.

Logs are buffered (last 2000 lines) and available via the HTTP API, filterable by source IP and timestamp.

### 6. OTA Firmware Repository

Serves firmware binaries over HTTP so ESP32 devices can perform OTA updates from the local network. Upload a `.bin` file, then point the ESP32's OTA URL to:

```
http://workbench.local:8080/firmware/<project-name>/<filename>.bin
```

### 7. BLE Proxy

Uses the Pi's **onboard Bluetooth radio** to scan for, connect to, and send raw bytes to BLE peripherals. The Pi acts as a BLE-to-HTTP bridge. One BLE connection at a time.

**Prerequisite:** Bluetooth must be powered on:
```bash
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
sudo bluetoothctl power on
```

### 8. CW Beacon (Morse Transmitter)

Generates a **Morse-keyed RF carrier** on GPIO 5 or GPIO 6 using the BCM2835 hardware clock generator (GPCLK). Designed for direction finder testing on the 80m amateur band (3.5-4.0 MHz). No additional hardware -- just a wire antenna on the GPIO pin.

### 9. Test Automation

- **Test progress tracking** -- push live test session updates to the web portal.
- **Human interaction requests** -- block a test script until an operator confirms a physical action.

### 10. Web Portal

A browser-based dashboard at **http://pi-ip:8080** showing all 3 serial slots, WiFi state, activity log, test progress, and human interaction modal. Each slot card shows:
- Connection status (RUNNING / IDLE / ABSENT / RECOVERING / DOWNLOAD MODE)
- Detected chip type (e.g., ESP32-C6) when identified via JTAG
- Debug status (active GDB port or idle)
- USB devices on this physical port (including non-serial devices like HID keyboards)
- Device node, PID

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Device not detected | Bad USB cable, unpowered hub, or device not enumerating | Try a different cable (data-capable, not charge-only). Check `lsusb` on the Pi. |
| Connection refused on serial port | Proxy not running | Check portal at :8080; verify device shows in `/api/devices` |
| Timeout during flash | Proxy not released | Use `POST /api/flash` — it manages proxy lifecycle |
| Port busy | Another client connected | Close the other connection first (RFC2217 = 1 client) |
| Stale slot data | Device was unplugged during an active debug or serial session | The workbench cleans up automatically on unplug. If stale, restart the portal: `sudo systemctl restart rfc2217-portal` |
| USB flapping (rapid connect/disconnect) | Erased/corrupt flash, boot loop | Portal auto-recovers: unbinds USB, enters download mode via GPIO. Check slot state in `/api/devices`. Manual trigger: `POST /api/serial/recover` |
| Slot stuck in `recovering` | Recovery thread running | Wait for `download_mode` (GPIO) or `idle` (no-GPIO). Takes 10-80s depending on retry count |
| Slot in `download_mode` | Device waiting in bootloader | Flash firmware, then `POST /api/serial/release` to reboot |
| ESP32-C3 stuck in download mode | DTR asserted on port open | Use `POST /api/serial/reset` to reboot the device |
| GDB won't connect | OpenOCD may not have started (classic ESP32 without USB JTAG) | Check `/api/devices` for `debugging: true`. Classic ESP32 needs an ESP-Prog configured in `workbench.json` |
| DUT not connecting to AP | Wrong WiFi credentials in DUT | Verify AP is running: `curl .../api/wifi/ap_status` |
| BLE scan finds nothing | Bluetooth powered off | `sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth && sudo hciconfig hci0 up && sudo bluetoothctl power on` |
| No UDP logs appearing | ESP32 not sending to correct IP/port | Verify firmware log host is `workbench.local:5555` |
| GPIO pin has no effect | Wrong BCM pin number or not wired | Verify wiring; only BCM pins in the allowlist work |
